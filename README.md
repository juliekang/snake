### To run locally:

Fire up your favorite web browser and go to File/Open.  Locate the snake directory and select the 'snake.html' file, and you should be good to go!

### Gameplay

Move your snake around without having the head hit any other part of the body.
Your snake grows longer with every apple you eat!

This particular rendition may be a little different from what you are used to,
as you can only use your left and right arrow keys!  Uber brain challenge!
